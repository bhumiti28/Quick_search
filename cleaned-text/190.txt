what context switching operating system internal vs external fragmentation mcq operating system mcq next prev internal vs external fragmentation what fragmentation fragmentation process data storage memory space used inadequately decreasing ability efficiency sometimes precise implications fragmentation depend specific storage space allocation scheme operation particular fragmentation type certain instances fragmentation contributes unused storage capacity concept also applies unusable space generated situation memory used preserve data set example file format similar systems example fat file system regardless amount fragmentation null extreme three distinct fragmentation kinds internal fragmentation external fragmentation data fragmentation exist beside combination preference enhancements inefficiency usability fragmentation often acknowledged tools processors similar things happen fundamental concept fragmentation when computer program demands fragments storage operating system os elements assigned chunks when chunk software program completed released back system making ready transferred next similar program afterward software differs size duration time chunk kept computer program demand release several blocks storage throughout lifetime unused memory sections large continuous system initiated large continuous sectors become fragmented smaller part regions time utilization ultimately accessing large contiguous blocks storage become difficult system internal fragmentation most memory space often reserved required adhere restrictions regulating storage space instance memory supplied blocks multiple systems outcome program demands maybe bytes get coalition bytes surplus storage goes waste occurs useless space found inside assigned area case structure called fixed segments struggles excessive memoryany process consumes enormous chunk matter insignificant internal fragmentation garbage termed unlike many forms fragmentation impossible restore inner fragmentation typically way eliminate new design instance dynamic storage allocation storage reservoirs reduce internal fragmentation significantly extending space overhead significant number elements figure mentioned demonstrates internal fragmentation internal fragmentation considered distinction assigned storage space needed space memory external fragmentation when used storage differentiated smaller lots punctuated assigned memory space external fragmentation occurs weak point many storage allocation methodologies cannot effectively schedule memory used systems consequence unused storage available essentially inaccessible since separately split fragments limited meet softwares requirements word external derives fact inaccessible space stored outside assigned regions consider instance scenario system assigns three consecutive memory blocks relieves middle block memory allocator use unused allocation storage future assignments fortunately storage reserved generous size available region use component data files external fragmentation often exists several files various sizes formed resized discarded broken document several small chunks removed impact much worse since retains equally small free space sections you see figure mentioned sufficient memory space kb execute process kb mandated storage fragment adjacent here use empty room run procedure use compression paging
