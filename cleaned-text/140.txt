represents object provides original actual value analog handclock analog device clock indicates time day instant time we live analog world sound hear smells smell etc infinite continuous nature hence said analog values analog digital terms commonly used together contrast digital term come computers computer understand digital values every computer device digital whereas human experiences said analog use analog different fields term analog broadly used field computing electronics both digital analog basic important terms understand concept computing electronics analog signal analog signal continuous signal information encoded continuous variable analog signal one timevarying variable voltage pressure etc represents another timevarying variable timevarying also restricted v v voltage range however infinite numbers values lie given continuous voltage range analog signals often use property related medium transmit data one place others electrical wires signals move wire transmit electric signals power station transformers houses analog signals represented plotting graph various physical quantities sound temperature pressure positions etc example below graph plotted two physical parameters ie voltage vs time vt graph shows continuous curve without breaking point discontinuity analog devices analog devices devices work analog signals analog devices combination analog machine media helps transmit continuous analog data one place another electrical nonelectrical examples analog devices follows electrical analog devices telautograph analog ancestor modern fax machine first device transmit pictorial information stationary sheet papers analog synthesizer devices help generate sound electronically analog circuits analog computers analog television devices help encode televisions convert picture sound data form analog signal however seen plotting graph amplitude frequency broadcasting signal ntsc pal unit various examples analog television system nonelectrical devices plenty devices help convey analog signals without electrical medium clocks governor steam engines planimeter calculate area closed shape kelvins tide predictor acoustic rangefinders servomechanisms speedometers etc analog computers analog computers computers work principle analog signals use various electrical mechanical hydraulic techniques solve various problems words analog computer one type physical system determines behaviour another physical system further modelling original physical system computer device called simulation characteristics analog signals various important characteristics analog signal follows analog signals timevarying electronic signals analog signals continuous nature either periodic nonperiodic less accurate signals comparison digital signals helps determine behaviours various physical parameters analog signals denoted curve straight line values lie negative positive analog signals originally generated hence record physical waveforms analog signals get affected noise data transmission analog signals require less bandwidth bw consumes power digital signal helpful audiovideo recordings advantage analog analog signals always helpful various fields important advantages analog signals follows analog signals best suited audiovideo recording analog systems cheap cost analog signals require less bandwidth signals easily process portable doesnt require graphic board provides accurate representation sound digital signal analog signals originally generated natural signals hence record physical waveforms density digital signal produce refined data disadvantages analog signals disadvantages seen using analog signals follows analog signals produce lower quality signals comparison digital signals analog devices much costlier digital also cant carried easily limits editing feature transmitting data synchronization difficult analog signals provides poor multiuser interface ui data analog signals easily corrupted what digital signal digital sometimes called discrete signals types signals used represent data sequence separate values point time unlike analog signals continuous nature discrete value time signals represented via binary numbers also lies different values voltage range short digital signals timedependent signals denoted sine waves two physical parameters key differences analog digital signals analog digital used convey data signals one place another analog signals represented electronic pulses sine waves digital signals represented binary digits square waves key differences analog digital signals follows analog digital analog signals continuous real signals digital signals discrete timedependent represented sine waves represented square waves uses continuous range values represent information uses binary digits represent information signals contain lower bandwidth contains relatively higher bandwidth data analog transmission may corrupted noise comparatively less noise effective hence doesnt corrupt entire data transmission flexible hardware implementation relatively flexible implement hardware best suited audiovideo transmission best suited computers digital electronics offers realtime processing lower bandwidth may may offer realtime processing also requires higher bandwidth doesnt contain fixed range values contains finite numbers ie gives observational errors due scale cramped lower end doesnt give observational error digital instruments dont include scale analog systems costeffective digital systems costlier analog power consumptions analog systems high consumes less power analog data stored waveform signals analog systems data stored form bits ie examples analog devices temperature sensors fm radio signals photocells light sensors resistive
