authentication authorization authentication authorization two words used security world might sound similar completely different authentication used authenticate someones identity whereas authorization way provide permission someone access particular resource two basic security terms hence need understood thoroughly topic discuss authentication authorization differentiated what authentication authentication process identifying someones identity assuring person claiming used server client server uses authentication someone wants access information server needs know accessing information client uses wants know server claims authentication server done mostly using username password other ways authentication server also done using cards retina scans voice recognition fingerprints authentication ensure tasks process one person files view read update mostly identifies person system actually authentication factors per security levels type application different types authentication factors singlefactor authentication singlefactor authentication simplest way authentication needs username password allows user access system twofactor authentication per name twolevel security hence needs twostep verification authenticate user require username password also needs unique information particular user knows first school name favorite destination apart also verify user sending otp unique link users registered number email address multifactor authentication secure advanced level authorization requires two two levels security different independent categories type authentication usually used financial organizations banks law enforcement agencies ensures eliminate data exposer third party hackers famous authentication techniques passwordbased authentication simplest way authentication requires password particular username password matches username details match systems database user successfully authenticated passwordless authentication technique user doesnt need password instead gets otp onetime password link registered mobile number phone number also said otpbased authentication famfa famfa factor authenticationmultifactor authentication higher level authentication requires additional pin security questions authenticate user single signon single signon sso way enable access multiple applications single set credentials allows user signin automatically signed web apps centralized directory social authentication social authentication require additional security instead verifies user existing credentials available social network what authorization authorization process granting someone something means way check user permission use resource defines data information one user access also said authz authorization usually works authentication system could know accessing information authorization always necessary access information available internet some data available internet accessed without authorization read technology authorization techniques rolebased access control rbac rolebased access control technique given users per role profile organization implemented systemsystem usertosystem json web token json web token jwt open standard used securely transmit data parties form json object users verified authorized using privatepublic key pair saml saml stands security assertion markup language open standard provides authorization credentials service providers credentials exchanged digitally signed xml documents openid authorization helps clients verify identity endusers basis authentication oauth oauth authorization protocol enables api authenticate access requested resources difference chart authentication authorization authentication authorization authentication process identifying user provide access system authorization process giving permission access resources user client server verified verified user allowed defined policies rules usually performed authorization usually done user successfully authenticated requires login details user user name password etc requires users privilege security level data provided token ids data provided access tokens example entering login details necessary employees authenticate access organizational emails software example after employees successfully authenticate access work certain functions per roles profiles authentication credentials partially changed user per requirement authorization permissions cannot changed user permissions given user ownermanager system change conclusion per discussion say authentication verifies users identity authorization verifies users access permissions user cant prove identity cannot access system authenticated proving correct identity authorized perform specific function wont able access
