facilitates basic services computer programs operating system necessary component system software within computer system primary aim operating system provide platform user run program conveniently efficiently hand linux os one famous versions unix os developed provide lowcost free os several personal computer system users remarkably complete os including x window system emacs editor iptcp gui graphical user interface etc obtained reputation efficient fast performing system linux operating system similar like mac os ios windows android powered linux os one widely used platforms world operating system software handles resource hardware related laptop desktop operating system handles communication process hardware software simply put select platform run embedded servers desktop systems around world linux one worryfree secure reliable operating systems available pieces linux linux os consists various distinct pieces some defined follows bootloader software handles computers boot process simply splash screen appears goes away booting os eventually kernel one piece entire known linux defined core system handles peripheral devices memory cpu kernel also lowest stage operating system init system init subsystem bootstrap space user charged handling daemons once starting booting process given bootloader init system handles process boot ie grand grub unified bootloader graphical server subsystem shows graphics monitor commonly known x x server daemons daemons background services scheduling sound printing etc either log computer startup booting desktop environment desktop environment piece several users interact actually various desktop environments select xfce kde enlightenment pantheon mate cinnamon gnome etc all desktop environments contain builtin applications like games web browsers configuration tools file managers applications desktop environment provide full array applications just like mac os windows linux provides thousands thousands superior software titles could easily detected installed most latest linux distributions contain app storelike resources simplify centralize installation application example ubuntu linux includes ubuntu software center permits us search quickly several applications install single centralized location why use linux linux derived safest ecosystem computer world includes reliability zero entry cost best solution desktop platform we install linux several computers without pay money server software licensing generally linux less susceptible various types attacks viruses malware ransomware opensource also linux distributed upon opensource license key tenants followed opensource objective freedom execute program freedom learn program working modify enable whatever want freedom reconstruct copies changed versions others freedom reconstruct copies help neighbor key points necessary understand community implements together creating linux environment linux operating system ie people people without doubt also tenants main aspect several people select linux freedom freedom selection freedom use what distribution linux includes several variations suit users we find several types linux flavors match requirements novice users hardcore users types versions known distributions distros all linux distributions nearly free downloaded installed many machines like burned disk usb thumb drive all distributions distinct take desktop opt various user interfaces like elementry gnome oss pantheon besides others interact traditional environment kde used opensuse os composed softwarebased collection linux kernel say distribution includes linux kernel supporting software libraries we obtain linuxbased os downloading linux distribution types distributions exist distinct types devices personal computers embedded devices etc around linux distributions existed famous linux distributions listed follows deepin opensuse fedora solus debian ubuntu elementary linux mint manjaro mx linux also server distributions available suse enterprise linux centos ubuntu server red hat enterprise linux distributions servers free like centos ubuntu server include associated price like suse enterprise linux red hat enterprise linux servers associated price include support well distribution selection which distribution use rely fact three general questions do prefer standard modern desktop interface desktop server how proficient computer user computer proficiency basic use distributions like ubuntu linux mint deepin elementry os skillset increases range use distributions like fedora debian however master system computer administration use distributions gentoo wish challenge create linux distribution using linux scratch searching serveronly interface wish determine wish commandline need desktop interface ubuntu server doesnt install graphical user interface means two things server would annihilated downloading graphics need good knowledge linux command line we however install gui package top ubuntu server along individual command sudo aptget install ubuntudesktop also system administrators want see distribution various features linux operating system applications linux billiondollar corporation nowadays thousands governments companies using linux operating systems across world lower money time licensing fees affordability linux used within several types electronic devices electronic devices easily available users worldwide famous linuxbased electronic devices listed yamaha motive keyboard volvo incar navigation system tivo digital video recorder sony reader sony bravia television one laptop per child xo motorola motorokr em phone lenovo ideapad s hp mini google android dev phone garmin nuvi dell inspiron mini drawbacks linux hardware drivers most users linux face issue using linux hardware drivers dont exist linux various companies hardware prefer build drivers mac windows due contain several users linux linux small drivers peripheral hardware windows software alternative lets take photoshop example famous tool graphic editing photoshop exists windows however available linux also tools photo editing photoshop tool powerful compare others another example ms office present linux users learning curve linux isnt userfriendly operating system hence might confusing many beginners getting begun windows efficient easy many beginners however understanding linux working complex we understand command line interface finding newer software little bit complex well when face issue os searching solution problematic also various experts mac windows compare linux games several games developed windows unfortunately linux because platform windows used widely so developers games interested windows installing linux idea install operating system may seem like complex task several people linux facilitates easiest installations operating system most linux versions facilitate live distribution means execute os either usb dvdcd flash drive without creating modifications hard drive we get complete functionality without committing installation simply doubleclick install icon proceed general installation wizard tried determined wanted use installation wizards typically walk us procedure steps preparation make sure machine meets installation needs also may ask us wish install thirdparty software like plugins video codecs mp playback others wireless setup essential using machine laptop wireless connect network downloading thirdparty updates software hard drive allocation important step permits us choose wish os installed want install linux beside another os known dualbooting use whole hard drive install existing linux version upgrade existing installation linux location choose location using map keyboard layout choose keyboard system user setup setting password username when system installation complete restart ready proceed next topiclinux foundation prev next videos join our youtube channel join now
