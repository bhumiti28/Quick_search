questions software testing interview next prev difference positive testing negative testing primary objective performing software testing identify bugs code enhance quality software application achieve two different unique software testing approaches positive testing negative testing both testing strategies prime features functionality testings play significant role check software application test kind application need provide input value validate results based given requirements before understanding significant difference positive negative testing briefly introduce positive negative testings examples what positive testing used check whether application works expected error detected time positive testing test considered fail positive testing technique whenever test engineer writes test cases set respective outputs positive testing test engineer always check good set values words say positive testing process system application tested valid input data primary purpose performing positive testing validate whether software supposed simple terms say positive testing implemented providing positive point view example numbers like example positive testing following example trying understand working positive testing suppose one test scenario want test application includes simple text box enter phone number according business needs accepts numerical values hence positive testing give positive numerical values order test whether working per requirement note generally application developers execute positive scenarios test engineer gets less bug count around positive testing get indetail information positive testing refers following link what negative testing implemented check application gracefully handle invalid input unpredicted user performance fundamental purpose executing negative testing ensure applications stability effects different variations improper validation data set negative testing also known error path testing failure helps us identify bugs enhance quality software application test once positive testing complete execute negative testing helps identify bugs enhance quality software application test we say negative testing executing keeping negative point view simple terms example abcde example negative testing let see one example help us understand negative testing effective way suppose one sample form mobile numberfield accept numbers value accept unique characters alphabets values however lets entered unique characters alphabets values mobile numberfield test accepts individual characters alphabets values we expect textbox field accept invalid values show error message incorrect entry get indetail information negative testing refers following link example positive negative testing positive method negative testing significant difference positive testing enter valid data instead false data expected result system accepting code issues lets see another example see positive negative test scenarios suppose one requirement password text box field accept alphanumeric characters let see table discussed positive negative test scenarios positive test scenarios negative test scenarios password text box accept characters password text box accept less characters password text box accept characters password text box go beyond characters password text box accept value characters long special characters accept password text box password text box accept numeric alphabet values positive testing vs negative testing some significant difference positive negative testing discussed following table sno positive testing negative testing checking application response help valid input data known positive testing checking application response using invalid input data set known negative testing positive testing implemented expected conditions negative testing implemented unexpected conditions positive testing doesnt guarantee good quality software product negative testing guarantees deliver good quality software product execution positive testing takes less time compared negative testing execution positive testing takes time compared positive testing validate available set test conditions consistently implement positive testing break project product unidentified set test conditions consistently implement negative testing primary purpose executing positive testing guarantee software application always meets developers requirements specifications primary purpose executing negative testing test web applications constancy contradiction inaccurate validation data sets positive testing doesnt encompass possible cases negative testing encompasses possible cases process system validated contradiction valid input data testing process contain validation contrast invalid input data positive testing less significant negative testing negative testing vital positive testing positive testing implemented every application negative testing implemented possibilities unpredicted conditions people less knowledge execute positive testing testing professionals execute negative testing makes sure software standard negative testing makes sure deliver percent bugfree software conclusion after seeing significant comparison positive negative testing conclude testing helps us increase software application quality ensures software bugfree software launched name recommends two opposing techniques highly effective getting quality software end day fundamental purpose implementing positive negative testing verify application works per given business needs specifications provides us enough assurance softwares quality finally say positive testing negative testing like two sides coin implies cannot overlook anyones significance case implemented output overwhelming ignored one final product would unpleasant next topicsoftware testing mcq prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest tutorials soapui rpa
