opencv cv abbreviation form computer vision defined field study helps computers understand content digital images photographs videos purpose computer vision understand content images extracts description pictures may object text description threedimension model example cars facilitated computer vision able identify different objects around road traffic lights pedestrians traffic signs acts accordingly computer vision allows computer perform kind tasks humans efficiency two main task defined object classification object classification train model dataset particular objects model classifies new objects belonging one training categories object identification object identification model identify particular instance object example parsing two faces image tagging one virat kohli one rohit sharma history opencv stands open source computer vision library widely used image recognition identification officially launched intel written cc early stage commonly used python computer vision well first alpha version opencv released common use ieee conference computer vision pattern recognition five betas released first version released second version opencv released october significant changes second version contains major change c interface aiming easier typesafe pattern better implementations currently development done independent russian team releases newer version every six months how opencv works tutorial learn computers perform image recognition how computer recognize image human eyes provide lots information based see machines facilitated seeing everything convert vision numbers store memory here question arises computer convert images numbers so answer pixel value used convert images numbers pixel smallest unit digital image graphics displayed represented digital display device picture intensity particular location represented numbers image shown pixel values grayscale image consist one value intensity black color location two common ways identify images grayscale grayscale images images contain two colors black white contrast measurement intensity black treated weakest intensity white strongest intensity when use grayscale image computer assigns pixel value based level darkness rgb rgb combination red green blue color together makes new color computer retrieves value pixel puts results array interpreted why opencv used computer vision opencv available free cost since opencv library written cc quit fast now used python require less ram usage maybe mb computer vision portable opencv run device run c prerequisite
