provides basic advanced concepts nlp tutorial our nlp tutorial designed beginners professionals what nlp history nlp advantages nlp disadvantages nlp components nlp applications nlp how build nlp pipeline phases nlp why nlp difficult nlp apis nlp libraries difference natural language computer language what nlp nlp stands natural language processing part computer science human language artificial intelligence technology used machines understand analyse manipulate interpret humans languages helps developers organize knowledge performing tasks translation automatic summarization named entity recognition ner speech recognition relationship extraction topic segmentation history nlp focused machine translation mt natural languages processing started year s year first recognisable nlp application introduced birkbeck college london s year s conflicting view linguistics computer science now chomsky developed first book syntactic structures claimed language generative nature chomsky also introduced idea generative grammar rule based descriptions syntactic structures flavored artificial intelligence ai year key developments augmented transition networks atn augmented transition networks finite state machine capable recognizing regular languages case grammar case grammar developed linguist charles j fillmore year case grammar uses languages english express relationship nouns verbs using preposition case grammar case roles defined link certain kinds verbs objects example neha broke mirror hammer example case grammar identify neha agent mirror theme hammer instrument year key systems shrdlu shrdlu program written terry winograd helps users communicate computer moving objects handle instructions pick green boll also answer questions like what inside black box main importance shrdlu shows syntax semantics reasoning world combined produce system understands natural language lunar lunar classic example natural language database interface system used atns woods procedural semantics capable translating elaborate natural language expressions database queries handle requests without errors current till year natural language processing systems based complex sets handwritten rules after nlp introduced machine learning algorithms language processing beginning year s nlp started growing faster achieved good process accuracy especially english grammar also electronic text introduced provided good resource training examining natural language programs other factors may include availability computers fast cpus memory major factor behind advancement natural language processing internet now modern nlp consists various applications like speech recognition machine translation machine text reading when combine applications allows artificial intelligence gain knowledge world lets consider example amazon alexa using robot ask question alexa reply advantages nlp nlp helps users ask questions subject get direct response within seconds nlp offers exact answers question means offer unnecessary unwanted information nlp helps computers communicate humans languages time efficient most companies use nlp improve efficiency documentation processes accuracy documentation identify information large databases disadvantages nlp list disadvantages nlp given nlp may show context nlp unpredictable nlp may require keystrokes nlp unable adapt new domain limited function thats nlp built single specific task components nlp following two components nlp natural language understanding nlu natural language understanding nlu helps machine understand analyse human language extracting metadata content concepts entities keywords emotion relations semantic roles nlu mainly used business applications understand customers problem spoken written language nlu involves following tasks used map given input useful representation used analyze different aspects language natural language generation nlg natural language generation nlg acts translator converts computerized data natural language representation mainly involves text planning sentence planning text realization note nlu difficult nlg difference nlu nlg nlu nlg nlu process reading interpreting language nlg process writing generating language produces nonlinguistic outputs natural language inputs produces constructing natural language outputs nonlinguistic inputs applications nlp following applications nlp question answering question answering focuses building systems automatically answer questions asked humans natural language spam detection spam detection used detect unwanted emails getting users inbox sentiment analysis sentiment analysis also known opinion mining used web analyse attitude behaviour emotional state sender application implemented combination nlp natural language processing statistics assigning values text positive negative natural identify mood context happy sad angry etc machine translation machine translation used translate text speech one natural language another natural language example google translator spelling correction microsoft corporation provides word processor software like msword powerpoint spelling correction speech recognition speech recognition used converting spoken words text used applications mobile home automation video recovery dictating microsoft word voice biometrics voice user interface chatbot implementing chatbot one important applications nlp used many companies provide customers chat services information extraction information extraction one important applications nlp used extracting structured information unstructured semistructured machinereadable documents natural language understanding nlu converts large set text formal representations firstorder logic structures easier computer programs manipulate notations natural language processing how build nlp pipeline following steps build nlp pipeline step sentence segmentation sentence segment first step building nlp pipeline breaks paragraph separate sentences example consider following paragraph independence day one important festivals every indian citizen celebrated th august year ever since india got independence british rule day celebrates independence true sense sentence segment produces following result independence day one important festivals every indian citizen celebrated th august year ever since india got independence british rule day celebrates independence true sense step word tokenization word tokenizer used break sentence separate words tokens example javatpoint offers corporate training summer training online training winter training word tokenizer generates following result javatpoint offers corporate training summer training online training winter training step stemming stemming used normalize words base form root form example celebrates celebrated celebrating words originated single root word celebrate big problem stemming sometimes produces root word may meaning example intelligence intelligent intelligently words originated single root word intelligen english word intelligen meaning step lemmatization lemmatization quite similar stamming used group different inflected forms word called lemma main difference stemming lemmatization produces root word meaning example lemmatization words intelligence intelligent intelligently root word intelligent meaning step identifying stop words english lot words appear frequently like nlp pipelines flag words stop words stop words might filtered statistical analysis example he good boy note when building rock band search engine ignore word step dependency parsing dependency parsing used find words sentence related step pos tags pos stands parts speech includes noun verb adverb adjective indicates word functions meaning well grammatically within sentences word one parts speech based context used example google something internet example google used verb although proper noun step named entity recognition ner named entity recognition ner process detecting named entity person name movie name organization name location example steve jobs introduced iphone macworld conference san francisco california step chunking chunking used collect individual piece information grouping bigger pieces sentences phases nlp following five phases nlp lexical analysis morphological first phase nlp lexical analysis phase scans source code stream characters converts meaningful lexemes divides whole text paragraphs sentences words syntactic analysis parsing syntactic analysis used check grammar word arrangements shows relationship among words example agra goes poonam real world agra goes poonam make sense sentence rejected syntactic analyzer semantic analysis semantic analysis concerned meaning representation mainly focuses literal meaning words phrases sentences discourse integration discourse integration depends upon sentences proceeds also invokes meaning sentences follow pragmatic analysis pragmatic fifth last phase nlp helps discover intended effect applying set rules characterize cooperative dialogues example open door interpreted request instead order why nlp difficult nlp difficult ambiguity uncertainty exist language ambiguity following three ambiguity lexical ambiguity lexical ambiguity exists presence two possible meanings sentence within single word example manya looking match example word match refers either manya looking partner manya looking match cricket match syntactic ambiguity syntactic ambiguity exists presence two possible meanings within sentence example i saw girl binocular example i binoculars girl binoculars referential ambiguity referential ambiguity exists referring something using pronoun example kiran went sunita she said i hungry sentence know hungry either kiran sunita nlp apis natural
