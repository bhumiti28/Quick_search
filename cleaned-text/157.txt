portability testing what software testing software testing process identifying correctness software considering attributes reliability scalability portability reusability usability evaluating execution software components find software bugs errors defects software testing provides independent view objective software gives surety fitness software involves testing components required services confirm whether satisfying specified requirements process also providing client information quality software testing mandatory dangerous situation software fails time due lack testing so without testing software cannot deployed end user what testing testing group techniques determine correctness application predefined script testing cannot find defect application main intent testing detect failures application failures discovered corrected demonstrate product functions properly conditions working specific conditions testing furnishes comparison compares behavior state software mechanisms problem recognized mechanism mechanism may include past versions specified product comparable products interfaces expected purpose relevant standards criteria limited testing includes examination code also execution code various environments conditions well examining aspects code current scenario software development testing team may separate development team information derived testing used correct process software development success software depends upon acceptance targeted audience easy graphical user interface strong functionality load test etc example audience banking totally different audience video game therefore organization develops software product assess whether software product beneficial purchasers audience type software testing we various types testing
