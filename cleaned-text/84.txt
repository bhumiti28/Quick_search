using python top projects beginners practice html css skills must do coding questions product based companies fast io competitive programming days code complete guide beginners experienced difficulty level medium do want become successful software developer dreaming getting big tech companies someone already working developer looking big move career well youre one surely might tried preparation might tried cover various topics you make plan try follow plan start preparation various resources tutorials videos you start learning couple days months realize youre going anywhere youre making progress things overwhelming youre alone happening many newbie programmers experienced developers try learn code try cover various topics due lack good roadmap guidance things become messy confusing during preparation miss lot important things cover help created practical roadmap days code based lot research experience software developers working big tech companies roadmap give complete guideline build strong coding habit achieve goal software developer all need laptop working internet connection determination solve problems regularly within months develop coding habit learn essentials crack interviews here covered what days code days code beginners days code experienced what days code what reasonable timeframe crack interviews big tech companies question comes mind every newbie experienced programmers well lot topics things cover youre targeting big tech companies challenge limited timeframe based research need say may take almost weeks days we divided complete topics days follow stay committed coding days follow approach stay committed coding develop good coding habit also able crack interviews tech companies we cover main topics days target interviews big tech companies facebook google microsoft amazon etc topics given data structures algorithms coding part problem solving system design operating system dbms database management system objectoriented design cultural fit few things need keep mind continue roadmap youre beginner make target solve almost coding questions youre experienced person make target solve almost questions system design round mostly asked experienced people beginners focus section less experienced one focus section youre beginner try commit time least hours every day youre experienced one need commit hours every day ideally shouldnt take minutes solve given problem keep mind rule applicable questions prerequisite we assuming youre beginner already completed projects college youre experienced developer surely might working projects days code beginners before go ahead keep mind newbie programmer overwhelmed many questions face lot difficulty solving problems its okay take time solving questions dont discouraged try solve problems first even takes couple hours after spending many hours dont get solution stretch days take hints progress see improvement also take less time solving questions day day choose programming language learn fundamentals you need choose programming language need stick explore various programming languages read try code editor check youre comfortable lot questions arise choosing language python better java c faster language i choose language java syntax complicated big companies working i know one language all questions create confusion also switch different languages try languages code editor explore languages pick one best dont choose language popular tech industry you need choose language youre comfortable almost take days picking language once choose language learn fundamentals already know fundamentals might created project language brush seen lot people forget basic things chosen language so need make sure good command chosen language learn basic syntax give online tests remember basic things chosen language may take around one week days learn fundamentals language few things remember readingwriting fromto files reading input console split strings d array implementation use very basics things language cc handling nullterminated strings lot companies lyft salesforce slight difference hiring procedure want candidate write code solve problems laptop you write complete program code pass given test cases you may work command line arguments may parse csv text files other companies google amazon microsoft use whiteboard so good know basics language handle coding scenarios interview so almost take days make decision language best youre comfortable resource c programming language c programming language java programming language python programming language you also try geeksforgeeks free courses fork python fork cpp day day learn data structures algorithms now time learn important part coding ie data structures algorithms subject mostly taught undergrad people ignore importance topic subject important thing cover coding interviews learn basics various data structures algorithms including complexity part topics given time space complexity analysis arrays stacks queues linked list trees tries graphs bfs dfs hashing heaps sorting searching cover fundamentals implement various dsa code editor you also need cover string part likely asked interviews youre thinking already know topics dsa give online tests test skill you surely find still need revise basic concepts learn implement array linked list stack queue tree etc basic foundation helps lot solving coding question skip good grasp resource geeksforgeeks data structures geeksforgeeks algorithms day day solve basic level problems once get familiar basic data structure algorithm practice basic coding questions practicing basic level questions help stretching mind prepare tackle medium level problems do skip basic level otherwise face difficulty solving harder problems go back basic level try solve almost basic level questions within days depending time speed increase number questions almost questions day within timeframe hours help building good foundation sample array
