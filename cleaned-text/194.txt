embedded service azure paas apis embedding dashboard reports when embedding content gives access latest power bi features dashboards gateways app workspaces two scenarios embedding power bi content embedding organizations users who power bi license allows us extend power bi service requires applications user sign power bi service view content after sign access dashboards reports someone shared power bi service embedding users customers allows embed dashboards reports users dont power bi account type embedding also known power bi embedded power bi embedded benefits isv developers customers example isv start creating visuals free power bi desktop minimizing visual analytic development efforts isvs achieve faster time market stand competitors differentiated data experiences also isvs opt charge premium additional value create embedded analytics power bi embedded customers dont need know anything power bi you use two different methods create embedded application power bi pro account service principle power bi pro account acts master account applications think proxy account account allows generating embed tokens provide access applications power bi dashboards reports service principle embed power bi content application using apponly token also allows generating embed tokens provide access applications power bi dashboards reports note while embedding requires power bi service customers need power bi account view application embedded content power bi gateway power bi gateway software required access data situated onpremises network gateway plays role like gatekeeper onpremises data source anyone wants access onpremises data cloud webbased app request goes gateway gateway attends connection requests access granted based authentication requirements gateway transfer data onpremises source client platform directly connects platform onpremises data source client directly access data onpremises location use making dashboard reports data analysis generally gateway used facilitate connection single data source multiple data source onpremises data source types power bi gateway two types power bi gateways standard mode personal mode onpremises data gateway standard mode onpremises data gateway allows connection multiple onpremises data sources one user you use data power bi azure logic apps azure analysis services powerapps microsoft flow etc you establish direct connections multiple data sources installing type data gateway data gateway helpful complex scenarios multiple users need access various data sources onpremises data gateway personal mode particular mode onpremises data gateway allows one user connect different data sources helpful one person needs access data sources create reports dashboards using power bi user cannot share access privilege users power bi gateway architecture power bi gateway functions play role mediator cloud services onpremises data sources onpremises data gateways run windows service windows service gets registered gateway cloud service azure service bus architecture working data gateway help diagram given power bi gateway architecture divided three parts cloud services gateway services onpremises data sources according power bi cloud service creates query requires data onpremises data source query cloud services goes gateway cloud service encrypted credentials gateway cloud services process analyze request forward azure service bus you dont need configure azure service bus separately power bi manages default azure service bus keeps requests sent forward onpremises data gateway onpremises data gateway decrypted credentials data source connect user data source onpremises data gateway forwards query sent cloud service onpremises data source data query executed data source sql server sharepoint files ssas etc result query returned onpremises data gateway data source onpremises data gateway sends result back cloud service via azure service bus building blocks power bi five building blocks visualization reports dashboards datasets tiles visualization visualization type chart visuals built power bi designers visuals display data datasets report example line graph pie chart bar charts graphical representation source data top geographical map etc reports report collection one pages interactive visuals text graphics together make single report example state city report sales country profit byproducts report logistic performance report etc dashboards dashboard single layer presentation multiple visualizations interactive visuals text graphics dashboard collects important metrics one screen tell story answer question dashboard content comes one datasets one reports example pie charts bar charts geographical maps datasets dataset collection data used create visualization power bi example oracle sql servers tables excel sheets tiles tile single visualization report dashboards example pie chart reports dashboard power bi report server power bi report server onpremises report server web portal display manage reports kpis along come tools create power bi reports mobile reports paginated reports kpis users access reports different ways viewing
