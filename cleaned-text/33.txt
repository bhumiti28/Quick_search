technique light wavelengths used transmit data therefore transmit data high speeds mac address also called physical address logical address source address destination address show answer workspace answer physical address explanation physical address also known mac address physical address unique cannot changed address stored main memory system which following addresses bit mac address virtual address source address destination address show answer workspace answer virtual address explanation virtual address also called logical address address stored virtual memory system length address bit example ip address edi stands electronic data interchange electronic digital internet electronic digital interchange electronic data internet show answer workspace answer electronic data interchange explanation edi stands electronicdatainterchange communication system data transferred electronically one computer another computer what maximum data transfer rate isdn mbps mbps kbps kbps show answer workspace answer b kbps explanation isdn supports data transfer rates kbps isdn circuitswitched telephone network system set communication standards digital transmission eg audio video networkrelated data arpanet stands advanced recheck projects agency internet advanced recheck projects agency network advanced research projects agency network advanced research projects agency internet show answer workspace answer c advanced research projects agency network explanation arpanet stands advancedresearchprojectsagencynetwork worlds first packetswitching network first world use tcpip model what size udp header bytes bytes bytes bytes show answer workspace answer bytes explanation size udp header bits bit means bytes simple transport layer communication protocol four parameters source port destination port length checksum which following protocols connectionless protocol udp tcp ip all show answer workspace answer udp explanation udp connectionless protocol means data transfer occurs protocol establish connection sender receiver wildcard domain name labels begin show answer workspace answer c explanation wildcard record type resource record matches one subdomains started example javatpointcom what maximum length stp wire ft ft meters meters show answer workspace answer d meters explanation stp full name shielded twistedpair cable similar utp extra mesh coating metal foil wires inside maximum length wire meters length meters cable loses signals therefore wire suitable small networks lans which network suitable building wan lan man pan show answer workspace answer b lan
