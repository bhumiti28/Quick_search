intermediate liquid state endothermic process pressure temperature lower triple point substance transition phase refers lower pressure substance would remain liquid form we may transform sublimation transforming material solid phase gaseous phase without changing liquid phase approach endothermic phase transition temperature pressure substances triple point opposite phase gas directly converted solidstate desublimation deposition transition solid gaseous state involves transition solid liquid state liquid gaseous state solids adequate vapor pressure given temperature sublimate directly air sublimation also shown solids high pressure triple level triple point occurs pressure temperature substance exist three states matter time elements compounds usually exist three states various temperatures examples sublimation various examples sublimation follows carbon dioxide dry ice essential example sublimation frozen form carbon dioxide dry ice exposed air dry ice changes phase immediately solidstate gaseous state recognizable fog gaseous state frozen carbon dioxide stable solidstate water water ice snow examples sublime move slowly temperatures freezing melting point line c partial pressure less triple point pressure pa during freezedrying substance dehydrated frozen water enabled sublimate lower pressure vacuum sunshine acting directly upon top layers snow causes loss snow snowfield cold period sublimation erosive wear glacier ice also part process naphthalene naphthalene organic compound another wellknown example sublimation naphthalene commonly present mothballlike pesticides mothballs naphthalene balls may easily sublime presence nonpolar molecules held together van der waals intermolecular forces naphthalene sublimates form vapors temperature f desublimates form needlelike crystals cool surfaces other substances iodine produces softheating fumes triple stage atmospheric pressure liquid iodine obtained keeping temperature iodines melting point iodine vapor expose latent fingerprints paper forensic science high temperatures arsenic also sublimate forensic sciences sublimation finds practical use dyesublimation printers help create
