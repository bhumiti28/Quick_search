protein synthesis next prev plastids plastid cell organelle found plant cells algae protists like euglena different types eukaryotic animal cells generally contain plastids plastids pigment containing double membrane bound organelle dna ribosome like mitochondria major function plastids manufacturing storage food besides largest cytoplasmic organelle plant cells formed proplastids found embryonic tissue proplastids double membraned structures stroma dna plastids discovered named ernst haeckel however clear definition plastids given afw schimper types plastids plastids different types listed chloroplasts chloroplast green plastid contains green pigment chlorophyll discovered anton van leeuwenhoek term chloroplast given j w schimper present green parts plant including green stems unripened fruits green colour due presence green pigment chlorophyll however abundance leaves mesophyll cells located epidermal cells leaves so leaves generally number chloroplasts part plant number chloroplasts per cell number shape chloroplast may vary cells species chlamydomonas ulothrix contain one chloroplast cell spirogyra chloroplasts per cell its number per cell higher plants per cell intermodal cell chara size shape chloroplast diameter chloroplast ranges micrometre contains s type ribosomes shape chloroplast also variable some common shapes include cup horseshoeshaped found chlamydomonas girdle shaped chloroplast found cells ulothrix ribbonshaped chloroplast found spirogyra higher plants shape mostly oval discoidal so number shape organelle variable furthermore chloroplast dimorphic organelle means exists two forms agranal granal granal chloroplast contains grana along stroma stroma lamella whereas agranal chloroplast grana stroma stroma lamella granal chloroplast found mesophyll cells c c plants whereas agranal chloroplast found c plants structure chloroplast chloroplast doublemembrane outer membrane contains less protein permeable smooth porins act pores small molecules whereas inner membrane also smooth contains proteins semipermeable space membranes called inner membrane space makes use membrane transporters allow molecules pass furthermore proteins ribosomes dna embedded stroma so also selfreplicating organelle like mitochondria inner space space enclosed inner membrane contains material called stroma stroma rich enzymes required dark reaction rubisco ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase abundant protein world helps accepting fixation carbon dioxide dark reaction inner membrane chloroplast shows invagination gives rise infold infolds flat disclike structures present look like pile coins called thylakoids singular thylakoid each stack thylakoids called granum plural grana lumen thylakoids connected inner membrane grana thylakoids different grana connected inner membrane stroma lamella term thylakoid given menke around thylakoids lie one another form granum plural grana grana stroma chloroplast like mitochondria chloroplast also semiautonomous organelle circular dna ribosomes its ribosomes s type called plastidoribosomes besides stroma also rich divalent ions mg mn fe chlorophyll pigments present membrane thylakoids pigments present form quantasomes discovered park biggins each quantasome group around chlorophyll molecules pigments include different types chlorophylls including carotenoids xanthophylls phycobilins single chlorophyll molecule comprises porphyrin ring long phytol chain attached ring magnesium element located centre porphyrin ring pigments quantasome along proteins form entire unit harvests light unit called lightharvesting complex contains photosystem photosystem thylakoids part membrane contact stroma called appressed part whereas part membrane contact stroma called nonappressed part photosystem ps present appressed part whereas ps present nonappressed part chemical composition chloroplast protein dry weight excluding water other components include lipids dry weight chlorophyll dry weight carotenoids rna dna small amount vitamin k e cytochrome f mg zn p functions chloroplast major function chloroplast photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide water glucose presence sunlight light reaction takes place thylakoid whereas dark reaction takes place stroma absorbs sunlight needed photosynthesis so serves site photosynthesis process plants produce food also plays role cytoplasmic inheritance contains circular dna genetic material ii chromoplasts coloured plastids contain coloured pigments like yellow orange red carotenoids coloured pigments except green coloured pigments so chlorophyll we say type plastids contains coloured pigments except green pigment so plastid contains coloured pigment apart green called chromoplast found photosynthetic eukaryotes responsible different colours flowers fruits leaves roots like carrot chromoplasts arise proplastids chloroplast ie chloroplast change chromoplast example green tomato turns red tomato ripening green leaves change colour autumn major function chromoplasts attract insects pollination providing attractive colours flowers fruits iii leucoplast type plastid unpigmented organelle contain pigment grana usually present nonphotosynthetic parts plant underground parts plants like roots tubers however also present stems leucoplasts perform specialized functions storage starch lipids proteins so major function leucoplast storage food besides shape variable oval rodlike filamentous spherical types leucoplast leucoplasts various types depending food molecules stored amyloplast type leucoplast store carbohydrate molecules oval shape found potato tubers elaioplast ovalshaped plastids store oil droplets fatty acids fat found oilseeds caster seeds groundnut sunflower seeds mustard seeds etc proteinoplast also known aleuroplast store protein grains found pulses maize etioplasts colourless plastids found parts plants exposed sunlight due absence light chlorophyll pigment destroyed presence sunlight convert chloroplast besides plastids interconvertible means one type plastid converted another type plastid example leucoplast develop pigment change chromoplasts vice
