questions flutter iq next flutter tutorial our flutter tutorial provides basic advanced concepts flutter framework flutter ui toolkit building fast beautiful natively compiled applications mobile web desktop one programing language single codebase free opensource initially developed google manages ecma standard flutter apps use dart programming language creating app first version flutter announced year dart developer summit initially known codename sky run android os december first stable version flutter framework released denoting flutter current stable release framework flutter v hotfix october what flutter general creating mobile application complex challenging task many frameworks available provide excellent features develop mobile applications developing mobile apps android provides native framework based java kotlin language ios provides framework based objectivecswift language thus need two different languages frameworks develop applications os today overcome form complexity several frameworks introduced support os along desktop apps types framework known crossplatform development tools crossplatform development framework ability write one code deploy various platform android ios desktop saves lot time development efforts developers several tools available crossplatform development including webbased tools ionic drifty co phonegap adobe xamarin microsoft react native form facebook each frameworks varying degrees success mobile industry recent new framework introduced crossplatform development family named flutter developed google flutter ui toolkit creating fast beautiful natively compiled applications mobile web desktop one programing language single codebase free opensource initially developed google manages ecma standard flutter apps use dart programming language creating app dart programming shares several features programming languages kotlin swift transcompiled javascript code flutter mainly optimized d mobile apps run android ios platforms we also use build fullfeatured apps including camera storage geolocation network thirdparty sdks what makes flutter unique flutter different frameworks neither uses webview oem widgets shipped device instead uses highperformance rendering engine draw widgets also implements systems animation gesture widgets dart programing language allows developers read change replace remove things easily gives excellent control developers system features flutter flutter gives easy simple methods start building beautiful mobile desktop apps rich set material design widgets here going discuss main features developing mobile framework opensource flutter free opensource framework developing mobile applications crossplatform feature allows flutter write code maintain run different platforms saves time effort money developers hot reload whenever developer makes changes code changes seen instantaneously hot reload means changes immediately visible app handy feature allows developer fix bugs instantly accessible native features sdks feature allows app development process easy delightful flutters native code thirdparty integration platform apis thus easily access sdks platforms minimal code flutter app developed dart programming language uses jit aot compilation improve overall startup time functioning accelerates performance jit enhances development system refreshes ui without putting extra effort building new one widgets flutter framework offers widgets capable developing customizable specific designs most importantly flutter two sets widgets material design cupertino widgets help provide glitchfree experience platforms advantage flutter flutter fulfills custom needs requirements developing mobile applications also offers many advantages listed makes app development process extremely fast hotreload feature feature allows us change update code reflected soon alterations made provides smoother seamless scrolling experiences using app without much hangs cuts makes running applications faster comparison mobile app development frameworks flutter reduces time efforts testing know flutter apps crossplatform testers always need run set tests different platforms app excellent user interface uses designcentric widget highdevelopment tools advanced apis many features similar reactive framework developers need update ui content manually suitable mvp minimum viable product apps speedy development process crossplatform nature disadvantages flutter we seen earlier flutter many advantages also contains disadvantages given flutter comparatively new language needs continuous integration support maintenance scripts provides limited access sdk libraries means developer lot functionalities create mobile application types functionalities need developed flutter developer flutter apps support browser supports android ios platforms uses dart programming coding developer needs learn new technologies however easy learn developers history flutter flutter free opensource ui software development kit introduced google used build applications android ios windows web first version flutter announced year dart developer summit initially known codename sky run android os after announcement flutter first flutter alpha version v released may later keynote google developer days shanghai google launched second preview flutter september last big release flutter version december first stable version flutter framework released flutter live event denoting flutter current stable release framework flutter v hotfix october prerequisite before learning flutter indepth must sound understanding dart programming android studio web scripting languages html javascript css audience we developed tutorial beginners professionals want build career
