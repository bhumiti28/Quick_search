tutorial matplotlib python plotting library human minds adaptive visual representation data rather textual data we easily understand things visualized better represent data graph analyze data efficiently make specific decision according data analysis before learning matplotlib need understand data visualization data visualization important data visualization graphics provides excellent approach exploring data essential presenting results data visualization new term expresses idea involves representing data graphical form instead using textual form helpful discovering getting know dataset help classifying patterns corrupt data outliers much little domain knowledge data visualizations used express demonstrate key relationships plots charts static indeed focus quantitative description estimations data provides important set tools gaining qualitative understanding five key plots used data visualization five phases essential make decision organization visualize we analyze raw data means makes complex data accessible understandable usable tabular data representation used user look specific measurement chart several types used show patterns relationships data one variables analysis data analysis defined cleaning inspecting transforming modeling data derive useful information whenever make decision business daily life past experience what happen choose particular decision nothing analyzing past may affected future proper analysis necessary better decisions business organization document insight document insight process useful data information organized document standard format transform data set standard data used make decision effectively why need data visualization data visualization perform tasks identifies areas need improvement attention clarifies factors helps understand product place predict sales volumes benefit data visualization here benefits data visualization helps make effective decision organizations business building ways absorbing information data visualization allows users receive vast amounts information regarding operational business conditions helps decisionmakers see relationship multidimensional data sets offers new ways analyses data use maps fever charts rich graphical representations visual data discovery likely find information organization needs end productive competitive companies visualize relationship patterns businesses crucial advantage data visualization essential find correlation operating conditions business performance todays highly competitive business environment ability make types correlations enables executives identify root cause problem act quickly resolve suppose food company looking monthly customer data data presented bar charts shows companys score dropped five points previous months particular region data suggest theres problem customer satisfaction area take action emerging trends faster data visualization allows decisionmaker grasp shifts customer behavior market conditions across multiple data sets efficiently having idea customers sentiments data discloses emerging opportunity company act new business opportunities ahead competitor geological based visualization geospatial visualization occurred due many websites providing webservices attracting visitors interest types websites required take benefit locationspecific information already present customer details matplotlib python library defined multiplatform data visualization library built numpy array used python scripts shell web application graphical user interface toolkit john d hunter originally conceived matplotlib active development community distributed bsdstyle license its first version released latest version released july matplotlib x supports python versions till june python support started matplotlib matplotlib last version supports python various toolkits available used enhance functionality matplotlib some tools downloaded separately others shifted matplotlib source code external dependencies bashmap map plotting toolkit several map projections coastlines political boundaries cartopy mapping library consisting objectoriented map projection definitions arbitrary point line polygon image transformation abilities excel tools matplotlib provides facility utilities exchanging data microsoft excel mplot d used d plots natgrid interface natgrid library irregular gridding spaced data matplotlib architecture three different layers architecture matplotlib following backend layer artist layer scripting layer backend layer backend layer bottom layer figure consists implementation various functions necessary plotting three essential classes backend layer figurecanvasthe surface figure drawn rendererthe class takes care drawing surface eventit handle mouse keyboard events artist layer artist layer second layer architecture responsible various plotting functions like axis coordinates use renderer figure canvas scripting layer scripting layer topmost layer code run methods scripting layer almost automatically take care layers need care current state figure subplot general concept matplotlib matplotlib figure categorized various parts figure whole figure may hold one axes plots we think figure canvas holds plots axes figure contain several axes consists two three case d axis objects each axes comprised title xlabel ylabel axis axises number line like objects responsible generating graph limits artist artist see graph like text objects line d objects collection objects most artists tied axes installing matplotlib before start working matplotlib plotting functions first needs installed installation matplotlib dependent distribution installed computer installation methods following use anaconda distribution python easiest way install matplotlib download anaconda distribution python matplotlib preinstalled anaconda distribution installation steps necessary visit official site anaconda click download button choose download according python interpreter configuration install matplotlib using anaconda prompt matplotlib installed using anaconda prompt typing command install matplotlib open anaconda prompt type following command
