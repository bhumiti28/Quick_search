difference microsporogenesis megasporogenesis javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference microsporogenesis megasporogenesis we studied biology classes th th many us go studies biology biology branch science deals human plant animal cells several different difficult terms biology focus plant cell animal cell out microsporogenesis megasporogenesis two terms discussing today so without ado let us begin microsporogenesis microsporogenesis defined process wherein small spores formed among seed plants spores formed within pollen sacs plants pollen sacs transformed pollen grains dispersed plants reproduce dispersion pollen grains helps plant reproduction microsporogenesis process wherein mother cell divides form pollen grains way fourwall structure formed called nuclei two kinds microsporogenesis ie simultaneous successive microsporogenesis simultaneous microsporogenesis process meiosis takes place meiosis defined cell division daughter cells half parent cells chromosomes present gametes plants simultaneous process cytokinesis takes place process meiosis result formation four cell walls nuclei kind formation widely seen dicotyledons hand successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis formed twice ie end meiosis i formation two cells meiosis ii formation four cells kind structure formation found monocotyledons far cell formation concerned five kinds tetrads cells formed forms tetrahedral decussate intersection formation isobilateral identical formation walls linear arranged straight line tshaped among shapes tetrahedral one important common shapes cell formation interesting know microspore considered first cell male gametophyte male gametophyte unicellular shape varies indistinctively inside male gametophytes thousands pollen grains wall covers pollen grains known sporoderm sporoderm divided made two layers wherein outer layer called exine inner layer called intine exine plants rigid substance capable handling heat pressure alkali etc hand inner layer thin comes time pollination germination cytoplasms pollen grains abundant nutrients microsporogenesis one important processes plant germination process helps plant reproduction includes plant development cell walls microspores haploid microspores end product microsporogenesis haploid microspores formation cell walls pollen grains linear form so important information microsporogenesis microsporogenesis helps plant reproduction germination dispersing pollen sacs thus process helps pollination plants flowers etc having discussed points microsporogenesis let us discuss information regarding megasporogenesis megasporogenesis process wherein development megaspores takes place megaspores developed megasporocyte megasporocyte kind cell undergoes process meiosis like microsporogenesis meiosis also helps formation haploid megaspore process four megaspore cells formed called monosporic megasporogenesis process one wall dedicated formation female gametophyte laymans terms megasporogenesis defined process developing megaspores meiosis process like microsporogenesis varied differences megaspore generally larger spore helps germination female gametophyte female gametophyte helps producing egg cells result plant reproduction megaspores found heterosporous plants now heterosporous plants defined plants different sizes different sexes heterosporous plants following things seed plants water ferns spikemosses interesting note plants megaspore produced inside ovule during megasporogenesis process mother cell undergoes process meiosis through process meiosis haploid cells formed flowering plants also known angiosperms include three kinds megasporogenesis ie bisporic monosporic tetrasporic monosporic megasporogenesis one important types process process majorly found gramineae rice wheat etc malvaceae cotton solanaceae tomato potato pepper etc bisporic pattern includes cell formation process meiosis i results production two nuclei megaspores one degenerates tetrasporic process defined process wherein cells fail even undergoing meiosis i ii process results production four nuclei megaspores so key points regarding megasporogenesis process somewhat like microsporogenesis certain differences added so let us see key differences regarding two microsporogenesis arrangement male gametophyte microspores hand megasporogenesis arrangement megaspore female gametophyte seen microsporogenesis takes place anther whereas megasporogenesis takes place ovule microsporogenesis many mother cells differentiated anther whereas single mother cell differentiated ovule megasporogenesis all four cells produced microsporogenesis useful hand megasporogenesis one cell four expected developed so key differences regarding microsporogenesis megasporogenesis both different structure arrangement help pollination germination plant cells both processes required plant reproduction thus microsporogenesis megasporogenesis important dispersing pollen sacs result plant germination next topicdifference prev next
