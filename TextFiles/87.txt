By playing this, kids learn the division. Now, the FizzBuzz game has become a popular programming question that is frequently asked in Java programming interviews. In this section, we will learn how to create a FizzBuzz program in Java. Rules of the FizzBuzz Game The rules of the FizzBuzz game are very simple. Say Fizz if the number is divisible by 3. Say Buzz if the number is divisible by 5. Say FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. Return the number itself, if the number is not divisible by 3 and 5. Note: Instead of 3 and 5, you can use different divisors (like 5 and 7, etc.) and string (Fizz and Buzz) also. Let's implement the above rules in a Java program. Java FizzBuzz Program There are two ways to create FizzBuzz program in Java: Using else-if Statement Using Java 8 Using else-if statement In the following program, we read an integer (n) from the user that is the upper limit to print the Fizz or Buzz or FizzBuzz. The for loop starts from 1 and executes until the condition i<=n becomes false. The else-if statement to check the number is multiple of 3 and 5 or not. FizzBuzzExample1.java 
import java.util.Scanner;
public class FizzBuzzExample1 
{
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
//constructor of the scanner class
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the number: ");
//reads an integer from the user
int n = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("The Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz numbers are: ");
//for loop executes until the condition i<=n becomes false
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
{
//returns true if both the conditions return true
if (i%3==0 && i%5==0) 
{ 
//prints if the number is multiple of 3 and 5
System.out.print("FizzBuzz");
} 
//executes if the condition returns true
else if (i%3==0) 
{
//prints if the number is multiple of 3
System.out.print("Fizz");
} 
//executes if the condition returns true
else if (i%5==0) 
{ 
//prints if the number is multiple of 5
System.out.print("Buzz");
} 
else 
{
//prints the number itself if the number is not divisible by both 3 and 5 	
System.out.print(i);
}
//prints space
System.out.print(","+" ");
}
//close the Scanner
sc.close();
}
}
 Output: Using Java 8 Java 8 provides the IntStream interface. We have used the following two methods of the IntStream interface. rangeClosed() Method: It is the static method of the IntStream interface. It returns a sequential IntStream for the specified range. Syntax: 
static IntStream rangeClosed(int startInclusive, int endInclusive)
 The method parses two parameters: startInclusive: It is the initial value. endInclusive: The inclusive upper bound. Using mapToObj() Method The method performs an intermediate operation and returns an object-valued Stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream. Syntax: 
<U> Stream<U> mapToObj(IntFunction<? extends U> mapper)
 The method parses a parameter mapper (of element type of new stream). It returns the new stream. FizzBuzzExample2.java 
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;
public class FizzBuzzExample2
{
public static void main(String args[]) 
{
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the number:");
//reads an integer from the user
int num = sc.nextInt();
//the rangeClosed() method returns a sequential IntStream for the specified range of int elements
//for-each iterate over the Stream and prints the elements 
IntStream.rangeClosed(1, num).mapToObj(i->i%3==0?(i%5==0? "FizzBuzz ":"Fizz "):(i%5==0? "Buzz ": i+" ")).forEach(System.out::print);
//close the Scanner
sc.close();
}
}
 Output: 
Enter the number: 40
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz
 Note that, in the above program the logic for FizzBuzz is adjusted into one line by using the ternary operator. It reduces the line of code. We have printed Fizz if the number is multiple of 3, prints Buzz if the number is multiple of 5, prints FizzBuzz if the number is multiple of 3 and 5, else prints the number itself.
