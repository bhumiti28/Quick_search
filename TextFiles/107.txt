 In this process, also insert the CDN versions of jQuery and Popper.js which is used for the purpose of using the different JavaScript components, for example - modals, tooltips, popovers, and so on. This needs to be before the minified Bootstrap JavaScript, if the compiled version of JavaScript is being used. There are some components that extensively require the jQuery. Following are some of these components - For using the closable alerts For toggling the states with the help of the buttons and the checkboxes or radio buttons and using the collapse for toggling content For the purpose of carousel for slides, controls, and indicators For using Dropdowns (the Popper.js can be used for perfect positioning) For opening and closing the Modals For collapsing the Navbar For using the tooltips and popovers (the Popper.js can be used for perfect positioning) For using various other components Downloading Bootstrap 4: The Bootstrap 4 can be downloaded from this link given below: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/.

Download - By choosing this option, a user can download the pre-compiled and minified versions of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. No documentation or original source code files are included. However, this does not consist of the documentation, the source files, or any other optional JavaScript dependencies such as jQuery and Popper.js. Download Source - By choosing this option, a person can get the latest Bootstrap SCSS, JavaScript source code and documentation files. Moreover, this option also needs some additional tooling such as: Sass compiler like Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported for compiling the CSS in the website. Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing.
