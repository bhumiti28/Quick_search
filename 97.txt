Peterson Number A number is said to be Peterson if the sum of factorials of each digit is equal to the sum of the number itself. Steps to Find Peterson Number Read or initialize a number (n). Find the last digit (d) of the given number. Find the factorial (fact) of the digit. Add the factorial (fact) to a variable Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the given number becomes 0. Compare the sum with n. If both are equal, the given number is Peterson, else not. Example of Peterson Number Suppose, we have to check the number (n) 145 is Peterson or not. Number = 145 145 = !1 + !4 + !5 =1+4*3*2*1+5*4*3*2*1 =1+24+120 145=145 We observe that the number and the sum of factorials of digits are equal to the number itself. Hence, 145 is a Peterson number. Let's implement the above logic in a Java program. Peterson Number Java Program In the following program, we have taken an array of factorial to quickly find the factorial. You can use the logic also. PetersonNumberExample.java 
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class PetersonNumberExample1 
{
//an array is defined for the quickly find the factorial
static long[] factorial = new int[] { 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600};
//driver code
public static void main(String args[])
{
//constructor of the Scanner class
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a number to check: ");
//reading a number from the user
int n=sc.nextInt();
//calling the user-defined function to check Peterson number
if (isPeterson(n))
System.out.println("The given number is a Peterson number.");
else
System.out.println("The given number is not a Peterson number.");
}
//function to check the given number is Peterson or not
static boolean isPeterson(int n)
{
int num = n;
int sum = 0;
//loop executes until the condition becomes false
while (n > 0) 
{
//determines the last digit of the given number    
int digit = n % 10;
//determines the factorial of the digit and add it to the variable sum
sum += factorial[digit];
//removes the last digit of the given number
n = n / 10;
}
//compares sum with num if they are equal returns the number itself
return (sum == num);
}
}
 Output 1: 
Enter a number to check: 145
The given number is a Peterson number.
 Output 2: 
Enter a number to check: 773
The given number is not a Peterson number.
